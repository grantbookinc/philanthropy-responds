## Giving Dashboard

See the data on how funders in Canada have responded to COVID-19 to better understand the impact areas, activities, regions, and target populations funders are supporting. Sharing data on how charitable giving is being distributed and learning about the initiatives of other grantmakers increases knowledge and capacity and broadens the impact of the sector.

##### Data Disclaimer

The visualizations on this website were based on voluntary responses submitted by a subset of funders in Canada. The visualizations will update in real time as more funders submit survey responses. If you are a funder in Canada, you can also participate by [contributing your information](/en/participate).
