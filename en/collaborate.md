## Giving Dashboard

See the data on how Canadian foundations have responded to COVID-19 to better understand the impact areas, activities, regions, and target populations funders are supporting. Sharing data on how charitable giving is being distributed and learning about the initiatives of other grantmakers increases knowledge and capacity and broadens the impact of the sector.
