quotes:
- funder: MAKEWAY
  quote: The COVID crisis has illuminated  issues of social, cultural, and income
    inequality, to name just a few. This is not an issue that philanthropy alone can
    address, and certainly not in its current state of operation.

  location: Toronto, ON
- funder: Toronto Foundation
  quote: Offer completely unrestricted grants, with little to no 'hoops to jump through',
    and very minimal reporting requirements. Everyone is overworked and overtaxed
    during this time.

  location: Toronto, ON
- funder: The Jimmy Pratt Foundation
  quote: There are a number of groups duplicating services in the communities. Foundations
    need to act as leaders and nourish environments that foster collaboration to ensure
    that both our dollars and the public funds stretch as far as they can.

- funder: The Sitka Foundation
  quote: Being a family foundation with a small Board, we have always been nimble
    and responsive. Now more than ever we are realizing the benefit of people able
    to convene and make decisions quickly with minimal processes.
